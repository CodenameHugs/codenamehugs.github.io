Hello! 

My name is Hugo Moraleida and I'm a Designer & Programmer with a passion for Lua, weird games and education.

Originally from Brazil, but hailing from Vancouver for almost a decade now, I'm interested in exploring different design spaces and experiences in games and how they can be applied to push the medium forward.

This is a space for me to write about my ongoing projects as well as register my ideas and musings about Game Design, Programming or whatever is currently holding my attention.
