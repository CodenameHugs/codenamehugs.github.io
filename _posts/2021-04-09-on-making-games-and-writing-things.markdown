I miss writing. For a long stretch of time starting in high school writing was a habit and an outlet. Short stories, bad poetry, dumb jokes, horror movie reviews… Writing was an easy way to capture the restlessness kicking around inside my head and externalize it in a manner that brought me deep calming satisfaction.
Being one of the few things I chose to not leave behind when I left high school, the habit grew into a definitive cornerstone in my career as a game developer when I started my first (well, first-ish) blog. Writing silly posts about whatever the obsession of the week was in my game making journey helped me document my progress in a time where everything was overwhelmingly exciting and I was overwhelmingly unaware of my own limitations. It was a safe harbor to keep track of my findings before I got lost into the next exciting thing in an uncharted sea of possibilities.

Writing also opened unexpected doors. It helped me get my second programming job, it gave me an excuse to make business cards and trade them with people way above my pay grade, it taught me to convey ideas (a skill without which, I wouldn’t be as good at my job as I am today) and expanded my horizons on where I could or should go next.

I never wrote with that intent in mind though. I didn’t set out to make a blog with the goal of pushing my career forward or getting eyes on me as a professional. I wrote because I enjoyed weaving my thoughts into words and conveying whatever barrage of ideas was floating around in my mind to whatever fool happened to stumble upon my little corner of the internet. It wasn’t quite my first blog, but it was the first in the sense that I did it with no other intention than self expression, rather than the insidious desire to become a famous game journalist or horror movie reviewer like my previous attempts. 

In the end, I wrote for myself.

I have been making games for ten years now, but the last post on my old blog went up six years ago. It was a temporary farewell that preceded my move to Vancouver, but the hecticness of adult life combined with the stress of adapting to a whole new way of living made that temporary farewell into a more permanent thing as I said goodbye to my writing habit.
I’m not the same person anymore, if I was the last decade would have been a huge waste. I’m now overwhelmingly aware of my own limitations and though I still have that same passion and excitement for creating interactive experiences, it now shares space with the small joys of adult life. 
So I return to writing not as a safe harbor for exploring an uncharted sea of possibility, but as a space to play with ideas and write my thoughts on game development at my own pace and my own time. I don’t know how long this little experiment will last, but in the end it doesn’t matter: I’m writing for myself.
