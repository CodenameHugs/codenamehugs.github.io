An edited excerpt from the speech I was asked to make at my students graduation ceremony last year:

First, be patient and be resilient. Breaking into the industry will take A LOT of time and energy, so when things don’t go your way, don’t feel discouraged. When it was my turn, for every ten positions I applied I received one “no” and the rest were silent. For every five “nos” I got a “maybe” and had an interview. I interviewed at about four different places before landing at my current job, so you can do the math on how many applications I sent. Just keep on working and improving yourself in the meantime.

While you’re at it, remove the word “aspiring” from your LinkedIn and Resume if you have it. You are NOT an aspiring programmer, artist, game designer or whatever else. If you’ve made a game, complete or not, released or not, good or not, you already ARE a programmer, artist, game designer or whatever else.

Once you do get your first job though, remember: be kind. The industry is going through an intense period of rapid change, and practices that were acceptable five, ten or twenty years ago no longer have a place in the studio.
There’s a strong push for diversity that is transforming the way we make games with a plethora of voices from different backgrounds now being heard. There are talks of unionization and better treatment for developers and until working conditions are fair for everyone those talks will keep happening.
The industry is changing and as newcomers you will also be protagonists of that change. The choices you make will affect your peers, yourself and the next generation of game developers. So be kind, and don’t be afraid to stand for what you believe is right.

Thankfully you’ve had plenty of chances to practice kindness with the folks graduating with you. Because believe me, you will see these people again. You are all about to enter the industry at the same time and honestly you are each other’s best allies. Make sure to catch up from time to time, and if you feel one of your classmates is a good fit for an opening, recommend them. Lift each other up.

Now, I mentioned this one in the classroom multiple times, but definitely need to mention it again: Take care of your health. The temptation to neglect yourself once you’re finally getting paid to make games is enormous, but that eventually catches up with you. You’ll make many games in your career, but you only have one body. Watch what you eat, exercise and get proper sleep. Fifteen minutes of stretching everyday will save you a lifetime of physiotherapy.

Speaking of self-care: Don’t burn out immediately after starting a new job. Take breaks! Games can be incredibly meaningful experiences, but there’s plenty of meaning to be experienced in other aspects of life too. You spent twelve months, eight to sixteen hours a day immersed in game development and, while that might be useful in a school environment, once you’re working full time it’s a sure way to burn out. Find yourself new hobbies, go for a bike ride, touch some grass. Enjoy your free time.

Last but not least and most importantly: Don’t forget to comment your code.

Cheers.
